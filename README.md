This project is  a memory game. I made use of flexbox for styling of the game cards. to set the cards in a row and column which was pretty cool to do.

How the Game works:
1. the cards are set to be matched.
2. select/click a card/image with a background image of a rubics cube, thia ia the backCard. 
3. when the image is selected there is a possibilty of the image/card matching the second card.
4. when it matches it will remain open and facing up. this means the match is a success,
5. when it is completed the game will give an option to play again and show the score of how the user has done (the score of how many wins).

// the structure is as follows:
common/
 App.js
 Card.js
 BoardGame.js
 Navbar.js
